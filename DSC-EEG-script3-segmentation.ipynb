    "## Segmenting the continuous data to look at **evoked** activity\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been looking at the continuous data. But in cognitive science, we most often want to study the EEG activity\n",
    "in relation to a stimulus presented during an experiment.\n",
    "We call the activity that is elicited by a stimulus, the **evoked** activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of EEG activity can only be obtained if we apply an experimental protocol in which stimuli are repeatedly\n",
    "presented at regular intervals; these repeated stimulus presentations are referred to as **trials**.\n",
    "To study this evoked activity, we create segments or epochs of data around each stimulus: the time of presentation of the stimulus\n",
    "is referred to as the T0 point and a time interval before and after this T0 is defined.\n",
    "The time interval preceding the T0 (stimulus presentation point) is called the **baseline**.\n",
    "The time interval following the T0 point is called the **post-stimulus interval** and it is in this interval that we study\n",
    "the change in activity that has been evoked by the stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes in EEG activity evoked by the stimulus are called the \"event-related potentials\" (ERPs).\n",
    "These are essentially deflections (positive or negative) in activity that can be characterised by:\n",
    "- their latency: when after the stimulus (or event) they appear\n",
    "- their amplitude in micro-volts\n",
    "- their polarity (are they positive or negative going)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the huge number of ERP studies carried out over the years, researchers have been to attribute certain deflections\n",
    "to certain cognitive phenomenon. For example, semantic processing has been found to be reflected by an erp called the N400...\n",
    "a negative-going ERP that emerges around 400ms after the stimulus. In general, the greater the amplitude of the N400, the more\n",
    "a stimulus is semantically \"unexpected\". "
